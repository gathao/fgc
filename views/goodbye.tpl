    <p> FightingGame.Community was always a passion project. What originally started as a way for me and my friends to track our stats exploded into a public database that tracked 24k players, purely by word-of-mouth. </p>

    <p> Unfortunately, for reasons both personal and financial, I can no longer maintain the site. <br/>
    It will stop pulling new data on July 1st, with player-specific data being removed soon after. </p>

    <p> Luckily, since this site was launched, alternatives have sprung up, such as <a href="http://v-league.pro/">v-league.pro</a> <br/>
    If you would like me to mention your site/app here, just <a href="/about"> contact me</a>. </p>

    <p> I will also be open-sourcing most of the code in the near future. Check back here for updates or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/fgc_status">@fgc_status</a>. </p>

    <p> Special thanks go out to UltraDavid, Edward "RLBS" Hung, David Cosgrove, and MikeZ. </p>

    <p> Most of all, big big thanks to everyone who ever emailed or tweeted me. <br/>
    Whether it was a bug, complaint, idea, or just saying hi, I appreciated every single message. <br/>
    It was your feedback and encouragement that kept the site running. I will forever cherish the experience &#60;3 </p>

    <br/>
    <p class="text-center"> So long, and thanks for all the fish!<br/>
